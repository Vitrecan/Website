					<h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
					<p>Ultimately, I am happy with my website. I did not enjoy making it, nor do I ever want to make another website every again. CSS was quite annoying for me to deal with as there were no error messages. When something didn't work, it just didn't work and you wouldn't know until you reloaded the website. The language itself wasn't hard to learn, it just wasn't a fun experience. I am also not a creative person so I spend several nights of coming up with a colour scheme before I even touched the website's code after submitting the draft in. So the web designing process was just not for me.</p>
					<h2>Website Structure</h2>
					<p>For the website structure, I was aiming for a minimalistic look to my website as I did not like the look of a cluttered website. This is why my website contains very few elements or colours that might distract the user from the content. The menu system is a navigational top bar that links to home.html, past.html, future.html and comments.html using the hyperlink tags. The navigational top bar was styled using an external style sheet connected by the link tag.</p>
					<h2>Page Structure</h2>
					<h3>Home</h3>
					<p>My home page was structured in a way that the user could see my profile picture has a background without looking too much into my face as I also overlayed text over my face, as I am quite shy. I placed a translucent black box underneath the text in order to increase its readability. I also used a span tag on my name where I broke my autumn brown shades theme in order to make it eye-catching. On top of the screen is the navigational top bar that will be a common element throughout my web pages.</p>
					<h3>My Past</h3>
					<p>My Past page structure consists of the texts that was left-aligned along with the least amount of element clutter on the web page possible, and aided with a table to summerise My Past at the bottom of the website. I used a different text colour for my table in order to signal to the user that it is not interactive, as compared to my navigational top bar. I also used multiple sub-headings and large margin gaps to break my huge text into chunkable paragraphs that can be quickly read without losing concentration.</p>
					<h3>My Future</h3>
					<p>My Future's page is also very similar to My Past page as it uses the same text-alignment as well as the same use for sub-headings and margins to breakdown the texts. The page however, features are more dynamical data representation that summerises My Future goals under a list. If the user hovers their cursor over the goals within the list, it will enlarge the cell under a different colour.</p>
					<h3>Comments</h3>
					<p>The Comments page is easily my most minimalistic page, which features the same sub-headings and margin standard I applied throughout my website with no new features underneath as I did not want to distract the user. </p>
					<h2>CSS Selectors and ID</h2>
					<h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
					<h4>CSS Div</h4>
					<p>I used a CSS selector to set the padding and margin of every web page to 0, with the universal font being Arial. This means that theres no gaps on the edge of every web page. I also used a selector on the nav tag so that the navigation bar would have a certain colour, be a certain size while having the navigational buttons being centred. The selector on list allowed the items wraped in the list tag to be displayed horizontally. For the hyperlink, I used a selector so that the list items could have transition effect while also changing colours when a cursor is hovered upon. The bulk of all these CSS selectors form the style of the navigational top bar seen on all of my web pages. I used a selector on the span tag in order to make my name on the home page more eye-catching. The CSS selectors on the section and body styles the spacing between elements, as well as the colour and size. This was applied to all my main body paragraphs. For the text for the main body paragraphs, I used a CSS div class called "text" which allowed me to uniquely style all my sub-headings without interferring with the native sub-headings I used for the homepage. I definded the the text sub-headings to to have a particular size, with a certain space underneath the sub-headings as well as the colour of the text. For My Past, I used a CSS selector on the table to style the size and location of the table. I styled the table headings to be a certain colour while being uppercase and to cast a shadow on the cell below it. For my future page, I used a CSS selector on a CSS div class called "list" which defines the top bar of the list as a certain colour with a specific size while also making the corners of the top bar as curved. I then styled the unordered list to have a slight shadow on each cell. I also applied a CSS selector on the hover to allow for the cells around to fade while the selected cell be highlighted with a certain colour.</p>
					<h4>CSS ID</h4>
					<p>For my homepage, I used a CSS ID class "Background" to create a background image of my profile picture. I then used ID class "Overlay" to form a black translucent block on top of my face, so that the text on top of the block can be more readable.</p>
					<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
					<p>I decided I would base the design on my website on a photo I took awhile back. It was inside the HMS Endeavour replica at the Australian National Maritime Museum. The brown colours of that photo reminded me of autumn, and so the design of the website was also heavily inspired by autumn. The colours I used are all shades of brown that reminded me of a chilly autumn morning breakfast, such as a hot cup of chocolate milk, or a coffee with a creamy brown foam on top. I also quite like minimalism in websites and so I strived to make my website very simple and filled with minimal elements, text and more whitespace. I chose Arial for the font as I thought it looked modern with the minimalistic theme I was going for. I used a selector to align the cells of the table left, and for every even number cell to be a certain colour.</p>
					<h2>Accessibility</h2>
					<p>I used headings, lists and tables to present the content in a different way to allow for easier readability. I also used span to highlight important information. The whole website is resizable so that no information can be lost. I aimed for a minimalistic theme, which means there cannot be any surprises that could shock the user. All my web pages are reachable in one place, which allows for easy navigation. I tried to make the text appear in the same place, which is why it will always appear left-align with multiple headings as a standard for display text.</p>
