					<h1>My Past</h1>
					<h2>High School</h2>
					<p>I first started programming during high school when I took Information Systems in Year 9 and 10. I however, did not enjoy it and did not continue to Year 11 and 12. After HSC, I did not know what to do so I took a look at ATO's highest taxed occupations and chose a job I could possibly see myself doing. It was software engineering.</p>
					<h2>University</h2>
					<h3>First Year</h3>	
					<h4>First Semester</h4>
					<p>I took a Bachelor of Computing Science at University of Technology Sydney in the year 2020, and choosing my major into Enterprise Systems Development during 2021. During my first year, I did Programming 1 as my first programming subject during the first semester. It was extremely challenging as I could not remember how to program. Worst of all is that Programming 1 taught Java and Python concurrently. This was a bit overwhelming for someone who has little programming experience. Despite this, I manage to pass with a Distinction, which probably was a result of me reading one of the recommended textbooks for that subject.</P>
					<h4>Second Semester</h4>
					<p>I then did Database Fundamentals with SQL for semester 2. The syntax for SQL was not hard, the theory however, was a bit challenging, especially since it was somewhat different from programming with Java or Python.</p>
					<h3>Second Year</h3>
					<h4>First Semester</h4>	
					<p>The knowledge I gained from that subject help me barely pass my next programming subject, Applications Programming which I took in the first semester of my second year, 2022. It too taught both Java and Python, however it was vastly more difficult that Programming I as we had to create applications. It was a challenging subject, yet I still enjoyed it. I manage to score a pass.</p>
					<h4>Second Semester</h4>
					<p>Now I am taking Web Systems, Applications Development with .NET and Theory of Computing Science for the second semester of 2022. .NET is quite enjoyable as it is Applications Programming with C#, Web Systems however, is a new kind of challenge as I am not creative and Computing of Computing Science is basically programming mathemical models which is as hard as it sounds.</p>
					<p>Here is a table below to summarise my experience with computing so far:</p>
